# Code of Conduct for AMPM 2021 virtual workshop

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at the AMPM workshop are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody: Be kind to each other, show empathy, and help make this a safe space to explore tangible, equitable solutions.

Our workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, experience, or religion (or lack thereof). Furthermore, harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other workshop content, and unwelcome sexual attention. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organising team immediately via: ampm2021@easychair.org
